				<h2>Summary</h2>
				<h3>
				<br>
				IXDA is committed to improving the human condition by advancing the discipline of Interaction Design. To do this, they attempt to foster a community of people that choose to come together to support this goal. Diversity, inclusion, and equity are core values. The IxDA Seattle website has few featured images. The images that are included seems to be stock photos that do not match the website as a whole.

The goal for this visual system redesign was to emphasize the core characteristics of IXDA  Seattle, which are fun, engaging, playful, organic, and to make their core offerings easy to find.

				<span class="highlight">Context</span>
				<br><br>
				<h2>Motive</h2>
				<h3>
				<br>
				Misinformation and fake news during demonitisation led to a lot of panic among people. A lot of people were stressed out
thinking all the cash they have would become worthless.
During covid-19 pandemic, we did not have much knowledge about the virus. This allowed exponential spread of
misinformation. A lot of the misinformation was unscientific and dangerous for our health.
A lot of fact-checking organizations were created to tackle this problem of spread of misinformation during covid-19. We
wanted to learn more about these organizations and their services to find the gaps and work towards improving the service.</h3>
				<br><br>
				<h2>Scope</h2>
				<h3>
				<br>
				Keeping the course deadline and the limited resources we had in mind, we decided to target the age group of 16-30 digitally
literate group living in urban and sub-urban areas.
				
				When the Covid-19 virus hit the entire world, so did a lot of fake news related to it.
Large amounts of misinformation were being spread through various digital mediums.
The state of misinformation got to the point where the World Health Organization (WHO) coined the term ‘infodemic,’ which
meant that just like the virus, fake news was being shared at an alarming rate. Fake information resulted in panic, confusion and
also deaths due to the wrong diagnosis.
This led us to base our research around fact checking, misinformation and the dissemination of news.
