				<h3>Summary</h3>
				<p>At Microsoft, I contributed to a few projects, with major focus on “Jugalbandi Studio”, an AI based no-code chatbot building platform aimed at democratizing software development. Its mission is to empower organizations lacking technical resources to transition their services online. Through collaboration with developers, NGOs, and government departments, I tailored the Studio's interface and user experience to address specific needs and pain points through iterative design.

				<h3>Most organizations lack tech resources to bring their services online.</h3>
				<p>This gap in technological capabilities leaves organizations struggling to keep up with modern demands. The inability to leverage digital tools not only limits their operational capacity but also affects their ability to scale, innovate, and meet customer expectations efficiently. As a result, they face several key challenges:

						<h3>Can we leverage Gen AI to empower novice-developers?</h3>
						<p>
							Gen AI advancements have significantly empowered novice developers, making coding more accessible and user-friendly. Many developers now rely on Gen AI for key tasks, leveraging its capabilities to assist them in various stages of development:

				<h3>Partners & Clients</h3>
				<p>
					We collaborated with a range of partner organizations that played a pivotal role in supporting the development and expanding the platform's reach. By working closely with various organizations and government departments, we successfully built and implemented chatbot services tailored to their specific needs, enhancing both functionality and user adoption.

					Our partners primarily supported the project with infrastructure, development, and funding. The clients were mainly government departments and NGOs focused on social welfare services. As a result, the expected end users included a wide variety of groups, such as people with limited digital literacy and those speaking regional languages. This necessitated accessible, user-friendly solutions tailored to their challenges.

				<h3>Let's start with a chatbot builder!</h3>
				<p>
				Chatbots have evolved from simple rule-based systems to sophisticated AI-driven platforms, 
				transforming user interactions with digital services. With advancements in Gen AI, 
				they can now handle complex interactions and provide personalized experiences, 
				making them an ideal choice for organizations looking to streamline service delivery. 
				Chatbots offer several key benefits:

						<h3>What kind of studies has been done in this domain?</h3>
						<p>
							As part of Jugalbandi Studio design and our ongoing work on an HCI research paper, 
							I conducted an extensive review of 150+ academic papers to explore foundational approaches 
							in novice programming for conversational agent development. While specific insights are NDA-protected, our focus areas included:

				<h3>What is the state of current solutions?</h3>
				<p>
					<p>To understand the market landscape, I examined products from similar domains, including chatbot builders, low/no-code tools, general-purpose generative AI, code generation AI, copilots, assistants, and generative AI studios.</p>
					<img style='height: 100%; width: 100%;' src="/res/comp.png" alt="competitor research">
				<br><br><br><br><br>

				<h3>What exactly do the organisations want?</h3>
				<p>
					I led an initial workshop with each client organization to thoroughly understand their needs and collaboratively create mockups of their envisioned chatbot solutions. 
					These mockups were iterated and validated with clients, serving as a foundation for aligning our development team and partners on key platform features. 
					This approach clarified the essential functionalities needed to empower novice developers in building effective chatbots on our platform.

				At Microsoft Research, I worked on diverse projects, each presenting unique challenges that honed my ability to prioritize and stay focused. Regularly presenting to senior leadership enhanced my confidence in communicating design decisions and addressing feedback.
				By creating tailored deliverables for stakeholders and leveraging my coding skills, I bridged the gap between design and development, fostering smoother collaboration with engineers. Coordinating with various organizations strengthened my stakeholder management skills, while deep research in conversational design informed more strategic design decisions.
				This experience sharpened both my design and leadership abilities, preparing me for more complex, multidisciplinary challenges.
